===============

These are sample MS Mathematics comprehensive exams used by the Department of
Mathematics and Statistics, University of Alaska Fairbanks.

These are *not* the authoritative sample exams.  See [https://www.uaf.edu/dms/math/mathcompexam/index.php](https://www.uaf.edu/dms/math/mathcompexam/index.php) for the official and current sample exams.  These were put here partly to back up the OIT-managed DMS webpage.
